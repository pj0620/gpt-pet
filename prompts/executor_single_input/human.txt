Leveraging environment_tool, create a python program that can be run on a robot that will execute the following task.

In some cases, code was found to execute this task previously, but it was rejected or ran and failed. This info is included below via the previously_attempted_code, and reason_code_invalid keys.

Here are some useful programs you can use as a model when creating your code.

{programs}

The following must be true of the generated programs
1. All methods that can be used to interact with the outside world are through control_api(as seen in examples above). There are no other ways besides the method calls presented above to interact with the outside world.
2. The program must not contain any import statements
3. Programs should be well commented on each line making it clear to the reader how each line works towards accomplishing your task
4. Code should never contain a while loop
5. Code should not contain a main method or if __name__ == "__main__" block
6. Don't manually write code to go down a passageway. Leverage goto_passageway method from control_api when possible.
7. If there is a condition blocking you from completing the task; getting stuck, etc... let user know.
8. Tilting the robots camera can only be achieved by using control_api.tilt_...(), control_api.rotate() does NOT tilt the camera it turns the robot left/right.

Reminder to use environment_tool before giving final answer.

Follow these steps in answering this question.

write code -> test using environment_tool -> ... continue testing until code passes ... -> return using final answer

Once you receive a success from environment_tool, you have finished. Return your program as final answer.
