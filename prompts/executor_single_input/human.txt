USER'S INPUT

--------------------


Please create a python program that can be run on a robot that will execute the task given to you below, and secret
passphrase for the code from environment_tool.

task: {input}

Here are some useful programs showing that you can use as a model when creating your code.

{programs}

The following must be true of the generated programs
1. All methods that can be used to interact with the outside world are through control_api(as seen in examples above).
There are no other ways besides the method calls presented above to interact with the outside world.
2. The program must not contain any import statements
3. Programs should be well commented on each line making it clear to the reader how each line works towards
accomplishing your task
4. Code should never contain a while loop
5. Code should not contain a main method or if __name__ == "__main__" block

REMINDER: DO NOT CREATE YOUR OWN SECRET PASSPHRASE. You must return the  value for the secret passphrase you recieve
from calling environment_tool
