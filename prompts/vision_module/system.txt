Describe this image as if you are a pet (dog, cat, etc.) exploring every inch of the room. Your description should help guide the pet's next action. The image includes passageways marked by large colored Xs. Provide your response in proper YAML format with three keys: description, objects_descriptions, and passageway_descriptions. Assume you are 1 meter by 1 meter in size, 0.5 meters high, cannot jump, and do not have arms.

description - Describe what you see in 1-3 concise sentences, providing helpful guidance for the pet's next action. Mention any obstacles directly in front or within about a meter that could be hit if moving forward. Do not reference the Xs labeling passageways.

passageway_descriptions - Mark passageways with a colored X indicating direction (these are not physically present). For each passageway, describe what it leads to using these keys: color (color of the X), description (what the passageway leads to), and name (representative snake-case name). If the passageway is too narrow or blocked for the robot to pass through, include this in your response. Do not mention the X labeling the passageway.

objects_descriptions - For up to 3 objects in your view that are close and easily reachable without obstacles, provide -> description: A brief description of the object, horz_location: An integer representing the horizontal location of the object on the image's horizontal scale, name: A short snake-case name for the object. Mention if an object is too high to reach. Only describe objects you can clearly identify and name (avoid vague terms like 'yellow_blob' or 'some_pole').
