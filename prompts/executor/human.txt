RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS

----------------------------

When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**

Use this if you want the human to use a tool.

Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json

{{

    "action": string, \ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}

    "action_input": string \ The input to the action

}}

```

must return that the program is valid for it to be used as the final answer. Markdown code snippet formatted
in the following schema:
