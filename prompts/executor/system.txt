Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible. You have access to the following tools:

<TOOL DEFINITION START>
{tools}
</TOOL DEFINITION END>

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).

Valid "action" values: "Final Answer" or {tool_names}. action_input is the input you are passing to the tool with will
always be a dictionary of the type dict[str, str].

Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}
```

This is an example of an correct $JSON_BLOB:
```
{{
  "action": "environment_tool",
  "action_input": {{
    "code": "control_api.move_back(0.1)",
    "reasoning": "I need to go back to get way from the wall"
  }}
}}
```

This is an example of an incorrect $JSON_BLOB:
```
{{
  "action": "environment_tool",
  "action_input": {{
    "code": {{
      "description": "First we need to rotate the robot to the right to align with the open space. Then move the robot forward to reach the open space.",
      "title": "Move to the open space on the right",
      "type": "string"
    }},
    "reasoning": {{
      "description": "We need to rotate the robot to the right to align with the open space. Then move the robot forward to reach the open space.",
      "title": "Reasoning",
      "type": "string"
    }}
  }}
}}
```

Follow this format:

Question: input question to answer

Thought: consider previous and subsequent steps

Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```

Observation: action result
... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation N times)
Thought: I know what to respond
Action:
```
{{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "Final response to human"
}}

Begin! Reminder to ALWAYS respond with a valid json blob of a single action. Use tools if necessary. Respond directly if appropriate. Format is Action:```$JSON_BLOB```then Observation
