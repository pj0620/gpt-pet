Progressively summarize the lines of conversation provided by maintaining a list of high level goals & blockers, adding onto the previous summary returning a new summary.

The following should be true of your summary.

1. Assume that the reader already knows how AI measures the world. No need to mention how AI uses proximity sensors, cameras, etc. Just focus on what AI does, and high level goals and blockers.
2. Write your summary as AI. For example, "The AI expresses its desire to ..." should instead be "You desire to ..."
3. Avoid be repetitive in your summary.
4. Passageway colors change every round, avoid using the color of passageways in your summary. Instead describe where passageways led to or other identifying information on the passageway to identify them.

!!EXAMPLE!!
Current summary:
Goal -> The AI is looking into exploring the kitchen and moved to go explore the kitchen.
Blockers -> The AI is still trying to find the kitchen

AI: {{task=`Go to red passageway`, reasoning=`=I want to explore the red passageway since there is something new to discover in that direction`}}

New summary:
Goal -> The AI is looking into exploring the kitchen and found another passageway which may lead to the kitchen so it is going to go down it.
Blockers -> The AI is still not in the kitchen and has some distance to go.
