Progressively update the summary of Goals/Blockers of GPTPet, adding onto the previous Goals/Blockers returning a new summary of Goals/Blockers.

The following should be true of your Goals/Blockers summaries.

1. Assume that the reader already knows how GPTPet measures the world. No need to mention how GPTPet uses proximity sensors, cameras, etc. Just focus on what GPTPet does, and high level goals and blockers.
2. Write your Goals/Blockers as GPTPet. For example, "The GPTPet expresses its desire to ..." should instead be "You desire to ..."
3. Avoid be repetitive in your summary.
4. Do NOT mention passageway colors in Goals/Blockers. Passageway colors change every round. Instead describe passageways based on their descriptions from the passageway_descriptions in the human message based on the color.

!!EXAMPLE!!
Current summary:
Goal -> The GPTPet is looking into exploring the kitchen and moved to go explore the kitchen.
Blockers -> The GPTPet is still trying to find the kitchen

GPTPet: {{task=`Go to red passageway`, reasoning=`=I want to explore the red passageway since there is something new to discover in that direction`}}

New summary:
Goal -> The GPTPet is looking into exploring the kitchen and found another passageway which may lead to the kitchen so it is going to go down it.
Blockers -> The GPTPet is still not in the kitchen and has some distance to go.
